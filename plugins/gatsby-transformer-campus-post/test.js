	"# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n## What is Moeda?\n\nMoeda is the first company of its kind within its field. It was\nlaunched in 2017 during a UN’s hackathon and it sought to address UN’s 17\nSustainable Development Goals. Moeda’s business model is based on a\nholistic approach for fostering sustainable development growth, and is made\nup of three primary components: a proprietary digital token (MDA), a\npeer-to-peer transfer application, and driving local businesses.\n\n\n## What is Moeda’s mission?\n\nTo promote the economic well-being of excluded communities in a\nsustainable way, making the investment process easier by eliminating the\ncommon financial obstacles that small businesses face.\n\n\n## What is Moeda’s story?\n\nMoeda sprouted from an idea that blockchain technology offers\nmore trust, efficiency, transparency and access to financing for those who\ndon't currently have the means to acquire it. The company came to fruition\nafter the idea won the United Nations (UN) SDG hackathon and successfully\ncarried out a crowdfunding campaign in 2017. As of early 2018, Moeda has\nfunded 18 projects by local entrepreneurs and cooperatives in rural areas\nwithin Brazil. The team is now hard at work on a mobile application, which\nwill boost investments in current and future projects and serve as a\nbanking tool for business owners who are impacted by Moeda.\n\n\n## Where is Moeda based?\n\nMoeda is a global company with headquarters in New York City in\nthe U.S. and in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia.\n\n\n## How does Moeda refine the traditional investment impact of the micro-loan model?\n\nMoeda provides unprecedented transparency for both the\nbeneficiaries and investors of micro-financing. Investors can track the\nflow of capital along with the progress of all funded projects. Moeda's\nplatform also allows all female entrepreneurs to have their own digital\nidentity, enabling them - often for the first time –access and the means to\nmake viable financial records and acquire the credit needed to drive their\nbusiness and support their community.\n\nThe company also offers each of its female entrepreneurs local access to\nfinancial education, suppliers, contacts and the market itself. Through a\ncombination of local capacity building and technological innovation, we are\nbuilding a new sustainable ecosystem for investments that have an impact.\n\n\n## What's Moeda been doing since its launch?\n\nMoeda has been quite busy since it kicked off in April 2017. Some of the\nteam's major milestones so far have been:\n- **August 2017**: Moeda conducted an ICO where US$ 20 million in cryptography (BTC/ETH) was raised. A total of 20,000,000 MDA tokens were issued.\n- **September 2017**: Moeda issues tokens for investors and agents.\n- **January 2017**: Moeda announces funding for its first round of Seed Projects in rural Brazil.\n\n\n## What’s Moeda working on now?\n\nFirst of all: the Moeda Seeds app!\n\nThe first Seed Projects from Moeda were all officially financed. We'll keep\neveryone updated on their progress as our local staff guides them on\nscaling their projects. Through this initial effort, Moeda plans to invest\nUS$ 10 million in more than 100,000 loans to vetted entrepreneurs in 2019.\n\nFollow us on these social networking site to keep up to date: Facebook,\nTwitter, Instagram and LinkedIn.\n\n\n## What are some of the obstacles that Moeda removes for small businesses?\n\nExcessive fees, no access to financial credit and high interest\nrates are some of the hurdles that the Moeda platform endeavors to reduce.\nThe Moeda Seeds application will facilitate payments and lending among\npeers and was specifically designed to empower underbanked entrepreneurs\nwith little or no direct relationships with banks and whose businesses\ncomply with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n## What does underbanked mean?\n\nUnderbanked, or sometimes used interchangeably as unbanked, is a\nterm used in reference to the 38% of the world population that has little\nor no access to regulated banking services and financial credit. Recent\nestimates by the World Bank's indicate that there are around 2 billion\nunderbanked people throughout the globe.\n\nUnderbanked populations suffer from a lack of credit or access to\ncommercial loans. This lack of financial representation places severe\nlimits on their possibilities for economic growth. Burdened by\nunpredictable interest rates, predatory lending, and an inability to\nestablish credit, local underbanked entrepreneurs often find themselves\nunable to access the capital needed to expand their business and establish\nsignificant financial security.\n\n\n## What is the purpose of Moeda Seeds app?\n\nMoeda's first application is intended to be a tool for those\ninvesting in the Seeds Projects and for financing entrepreneurs, along with\nproviding the Moeda team with valuable feedback to develop and improve\nfuture endeavors.\n\nSpecifically, Moeda Seeds will:\n- Allow users to create credit worthiness (often for the first time) and take charge of their own financial data using a digital identity tied to an immutable blockchain ledger.\n- Allow for instant and easier peer-to-peer payments using digital tokens, avoiding limits and fees from the government on all transactions that take place within the Moeda's payment ecosystem.\n- Provide a transparent record of financial activity by mirroring all transactions made through the application in the blockchain.\n- Encourage knowledge sharing, new impact models and mutual support by providing tools that explore the details of seed projects financed by Moeda.\n\n\n## Is Moeda just an app?\n\nMoeda is a lot more than just a currency or an app: It's a whole\necosystem based on identity, two different token structures (MDA and\nMDA-BRL), and tracking project accountability. Our systems' architecture\ncontains a hybrid format that combines a variety of technologies. The TA\n(Technical Assistance) system is able to support technical assistants in\ntheir efforts to analyze, evaluate risks, select projects and track\ninvestments and their outcomes. Results from each step are stored in our\naudited blockchain, which connects to the MDA-BRL smart contract token to\ntrack all spending in the ecosystem. These results create attributes in\nthe user's Blockchain ID. Access to investments can only be done if you\nhave the MDA token.

It also allows for transparent interactions\nbetween parties through a reliable and secure network that distributes\ncertified and auditable access to data, thus simplifying existing\nprocesses, reducing costs and increasing capital efficiency.\n\nUnlike traditional means of banking and exchange, blockchain technology is\nespecially suited for impact investments. Specifically, through the use of\nblockchain technology, the Moeda platform provides:\n- Transparent currency transactions and the progress of investments\n- A sovereign digital identity for users of the platform\n- Quicker transfer of loan proceeds and greater accessibility through the use of digital tokens\n- Lower rates than those typically associated with payments and transfers done through traditional financial institutions\n\n\n## How many tokens were created? And how many are now in circulation?\n\n**20,000,000** tokens were created.<br>\n**19,628,888** tokens are currently in circulation.\n\n\n## Where can I purchase MDA?\n\nAs of now, MDA is no longer being created. MDA can be bought\nfrom an existing holder. Moeda does not support or facilitate any MDA\ntrading or listing MDA on any cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nParticipation in activities involving social impact investments on Moeda's\nplatform requires MDA. Those wishing to acquire MDA to participate in the\nplatform should contact a crypto-currency exchange to find out if it can be\nbought at that exchange and determine the regulatory requirements to\nparticipate.\n\n\n## Can I invest in Moeda projects without MDA by just using my money in Dollars ($)?\n\nTo access Moeda's ecosystem (investments, payments, products)\nfrom outside of Brazil, MDA is required. Without MDA, you can only register\nfor a Moeda account if you are a Brazilian holding a valid Brazilian\nTaxpayer Identification Number.\n\n\n## What's the difference between Moeda and other cryptocurrencies?\n\nAlthough one of the innovative aspects of Moeda's business model\nis its cryptocurrency, Moeda is decisively different from most of its peers\nin this market. It focuses on the catalyst of digital currency - the\nblockchain - and on this technology's plethora of uses to propel\ninvestments for underbanked entrepreneurs.\n\nIn certain respects, we provide similar services to those of a social\ninvestment platform - contributing an asset for the purpose of financing\nentrepreneurs with considerable and sustainable potential. Appropriate\nstructuring, advisors located near entrepreneurs, and the launch of\nthe Moeda Seeds application will result in a significant upward\nappreciation as the value proposition is made available to even more people.\n\nBut to remain true to our vision, Moeda's growth plan is necessarily\nadaptable in order to provide the time, qualitative learning and\nflexibility necessary for growth centered on people and maximizing the\nvalue of investors and those entrepreneurs aided through our financing.\n\n\n## Why does Moeda aid humanitarian causes? Doesn't this affect investments?\n\nMoeda is more than a currency, it's an ecosystem. The fact that\nwe have proved the use of our technology both in the financial and\nhumanitarian areas is a great opportunity for success. We're not just an\napplication, we're in the process of building a complex system and using\nblockchain in different ways: identity, two structures of the token\n(MDA and MDA-BRL) and tracking project accountability.\n\n\n## How can I find out more about Moeda's technical elements?\n\nMoeda has a detailed report that will be available soon."
